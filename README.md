# Telecommunication Industry Forecast of Customer Churn

In this project, I use many supervised learning models to identify customers who are likely to stop using the service in the future. Furthermore, I will analyze the top factors that influence user retention.

* The use of many algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest, for the telecom company to help forecast the churn probability in Python

* Applied Pearson correlation coefficient to analyze feature importance and rank key features that affect the probability of the churn
